# Developer note


I have refactored the code with the following things in mind:

 - Adherence to SOLID principles : I achieved this by using classes (services) and interfaces properly,
removing unused and duplicate variables, avoiding unnecessary and complex loops,
separating complex logic into small units and implementing dependency injection(Constructor Injection)
 - Testability : Implemented interfaces for Testability
 - Readability : I achieved this through proper naming of object, class, interface,
services and no complex coding
 - Extensibility for new incentive types : Introduced factory design concept
